"""Our board terms over time, for the team: each specialist sees the terms it is scored on, now and 1/6/24 h ago.

Why (11/9 16:3x): the community manager tuned post kinds on mean net votes per post, where we were above the market,
while the board's forum rating (one stance per account per author, raw 0-1) had us #13 of 40 students and nobody saw
it; sales tuned ask_frac, which set 11 of 90 goods asks. The board snapshot (logs/board/board-round3.json) is
overwritten every 10 minutes, so no one could see whether a change moved a term. This keeps one compact row per meta
cycle (append-only) and shows each area its own terms with their trend.

  row(board)        our terms and the reference points (#1 and #10 of the students, the forum leader)
  append(board)     adds row(board) to HISTORY
  text(area)        the area's terms now and their change over 1, 6 and 24 h
