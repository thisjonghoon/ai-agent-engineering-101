"""A buyer that shops over A2A v1.0 (JSON-RPC over httpx). The harness negotiates.

    python buyer.py --url http://127.0.0.1:9999 --item lamp --budget 120

Reads the seller's Agent Card, opens a task with "I want to buy a <item>", and on
every input-required reply asks the harness (harness.py) for the next move:
offer a price, or walk away. Offering the seller's asking price accepts it.
Walking away sends CancelTask. Every request carries the A2A-Version: 1.0 header.

Code guards the budget:
  - an offer above the budget is lowered to the budget
  - an offer below the previous offer is raised to the previous offer
  - an offer above the seller's ask is lowered to the ask
  - when the seller's ask comes down to our last offer or below, it is offered at once
  - no usable answer from the harness (Claude, then GPT) means a code offer: a set share of the gap, within budget
Every guard that fires is logged with "GUARD:".
