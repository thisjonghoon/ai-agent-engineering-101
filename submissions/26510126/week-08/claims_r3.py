"""Checks the numbers our standing orders and memory state as facts against the market's board, now.

Why (11/9 16:2x): the supervisor wrote "our forum rating leads the market (0.909)" into the standing orders and its
memory from a comparison with a few top players; the board had us #13 of 40 students. The team read it every cycle and
nothing checked it. The memory study (Anthropic, components of agent memory) closes the loop by fixing notes against the
record; the team's lessons already drop rules that cite no fact (lessons_r3.valid). This does the same for the
supervisor's own claims.

  Since 11/9 17:1x the standing orders carry no board numbers: {live:key} is filled from the board as the team
  reads them (board_terms_r3.render), so claims_r3.json is empty and this mostly catches a number typed in again.
  claims_r3.json   one row per claim: {"id", "file", "says" (text that must still be in the file), "metric",
                   "value", "tol", "as_of"}. A claim whose `says` text is gone from its file is retired.
  check(board)     [(claim, now, status)] with status ok / STALE / retired.
  loose(text)      "#N of M" ranks in a file that no claim covers, so a new unchecked fact is caught too.
  reconcile()      the loops' own shop metric against the board's Book over 6 h. 11/4-11/7 shop_margin_h counted
                   signed receipts, read 2-4M/h while Book grew 0.7-0.9M/h, and nobody saw it for 2.6 days (101789f);
                   every search on a metric is only as right as the metric (DSPy/GEPA, AX week-02/05). On 11/10 the
                   6 h sums were 8.9M vs 7.1M; the bar is a gap over max(60% of the Book change, 5M).

    python claims_r3.py           # prints every claim; exit 1 when one is STALE or a rank is unregistered
