"""Hidden demand, estimated from what reaches us (Round 3).

The market hides what sells: Round 3 `order` entries on the ledger carry no item or budget, and demand.json has no
weights. The instructor said (11/3) that the orders still follow a popularity ranking the market keeps hashed. Two
signals reach our own agents and nobody else's, and both are samples of that hidden demand:
  - every order our buyer gets (order.json): its category, and its `acceptable` SKUs, which are the category's SKUs
    priced 0.5-1.5x a hidden reference price. The middle of that band, (cheapest + dearest) / 2, estimates the
    reference, and the SKU nearest it is the product the order was drawn around. Counting those over two weeks
    ranks categories and products by how often orders come for them, settled or not;
  - every request to our shop (the buyer names a SKU or a category): what buyers came to us for, including what we
    did not have (a missed sale is demand we could not see in any settle).
The ledger's settles, the third signal, stay in restock_r3.py. Each event is one line in logs/demand_r3.jsonl,
so the estimate survives restarts and the report can show it.

    python demand_r3.py      # prints the top categories, products and reference prices so far
