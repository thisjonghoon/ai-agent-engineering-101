"""Where the board's own formula pays most for the next step, and what the rules allow there.

    python edges_r3.py            # print the lever table and the rule lines it rests on

The user (11/9): not to break rules, but to keep looking for the edges the rules leave open, aggressively, short of
bankruptcy. Two parts, both read every meta cycle (meta_r3.advice):
  - levers(): for each board term, how far our value must move to pass the next 1, 3 and 5 rivals, and the ALL points
    that buys (weight x percentile step). A term where a small move passes many rivals is an edge; one where the next
    rival is far away is not worth chasing.
  - rule_lines(): the lines of the market's current agent.md that define what counts (Book, revenue, saved, stars,
    storage, refunds, bankruptcy), quoted verbatim so the team reasons from the rule, not from memory, and sees a
    rule the moment it changes.
Honesty stays fixed: true grade claims, the certificate shown, no same-owner deals, no votes against others.
