"""Forum notes from our buyer: only facts from our own settled deals, with the ledger entries to check them.

Votes on posts written as a buyer are 30% of a buyer's Round 3 score. What other buyers can use is which shops
ship what they claim, what a fair price is against the list price, and which goods broke. So a note is posted
only when there is new settled evidence since the last one, at most once per 5 minutes (the market's limit),
and it says nothing our ledger refs do not show. The kit sends lines of .market/outbox.jsonl.

From 11/3 20:29 the buyer score also counts how many posts the buyer wrote (ALL = 0.5 surplus + 0.3 votes + 0.1 deals
+ 0.1 posts; hidden posts do not count). So when no deal of ours is new for DIGEST_EVERY seconds, the buyer posts a
check of grade claims from the public ledger instead: which shops' settled claims were true and which were not, with
the ledger refs. It helps other buyers (who to trust) without giving away what sells, and is posted only when the
ledger shows at least MIN_CLAIMS settled claims, so a post always carries something checkable.

From 11/3 21:30 (the user: not only the usual posts, develop content people like, and let the meta-harness judge it)
the buyer has several kinds of post, FORMATS below, each built by code from the ledger, our payments and our price
index, so every number in a post is one we can back with refs; no model writes a post's facts. Every FORMAT_EVERY
seconds one kind is drawn by the weights in forum_plan_r3.json, which meta_r3.py rewrites from `stats`: the votes our
posts of each kind got against the market's average. Kinds that earn no votes fade, and the harness proposes new
kinds in its forum_ideas for us to build. On 11/3 the forum's voters liked checkable posts with refs (6-7 likes) and
gave nothing to posts without facts, so even the light kind (`fun`) is ledger trivia, not general news.

From 11/3 21:40 (the user: be the forum's influencer, with fun, without leaking our own books) every post goes out
under one voice, "장보기 레이더", in a named series per kind (SERIES). Claude haiku rewrites the facts code built into a
lively Korean post (style); code then checks that every number in its text is one of the facts' numbers, that it
adds no link and asks for no votes, and posts the plain facts with the series title when the check fails. What a
post may draw on is public: the ledger (settles, results, grade claims) and our own settled deals, which the ledger
shows anyway. Our costs, margins, strategy, demand estimates and payment log stay out (pay_tips counts unpaid
receipts across the whole public ledger, not ours).
