"""The meta-harness as a team: four specialists propose, a manager decides (11/4, the user: run it like a team).

One prompt that covered pricing, stock, the buyer and the forum grew past its 60,000-character guard (11/4 09:57)
and mixed its evidence up (it raised our stock depth for other shops' stock-outs, 10:04). Here each specialist reads
only its own evidence and proposes changes to its own numbers, all four at once (Claude haiku, one call each):
  - sales: the shop's prices, concessions, warranty, the seller model's share, an A/B test, a seller recruit;
  - merchandising: what the shop stocks and how much (max_list, goods_frac, depth, cash kept back ...);
  - buying: the buyer's numbers (buyer_plan_r3.json) and a buyer recruit;
  - community: the buyer's forum post kinds and new kinds.
The manager sees our standing, the supervisor's notes and the four proposals with their reasons, approves, trims or
rejects each (keeping changes few, so each can be judged), and answers in the single-prompt format, so meta_r3.py's
code that bounds, applies and logs a decision is unchanged. When the manager fails, the proposals are merged as they
are; when every specialist fails, meta_r3.py falls back to its single prompt.
