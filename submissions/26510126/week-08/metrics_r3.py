"""What the midterm grades, and the numbers a change is judged by.

score_gap(): the board's Players rank is shop ALL + buyer ALL, each a weighted sum of percentiles (agent.md: shops by
profit 0.5, revenue 0.3, stars 0.2; buyers by surplus 0.5, forum votes 0.3, deals 0.1, posts 0.1). For each term it
gives our percentile and the points it leaves on the table (weight x (1 - percentile)), so the harness works on the
term that costs most, not on the one it happens to see.

window(t0, t1): the fixed metrics a hypothesis may name, from our own logs (code computes them, no model):
  buyer_close_rate      paid orders / orders
  buyer_surplus_order   (list - price) of paid deals / orders
  buyer_paid_h          paid deals per hour
  shelf_refused_h       payments the kit refused for too little shelf life, per hour
  shop_deals_h          our sales paid on the ledger per hour (not receipts signed: buyers pay one of several shops)
  shop_margin_h         (price - cost) of those deals per hour
  forum_votes_post      net votes per post our buyer wrote in the window (forum.json keeps the newest 100 posts, so
                        only the last hours can be read; forum votes are 0.3 of the buyer's ALL)
  buyer_saved_deal      mean of (list - price) / list over the paid deals: the board's saved term per deal (11/6 06:02
                        rules), so a cheap order counts as much as a dear one; goods that break later count -1 on the
                        board, which this window cannot see yet
  buyer_dear_close      paid orders / orders among orders whose reference price is DEAR or more. 11/3 21:00-11/5 11:00:
                        the 216 orders of 300k or more (5%) gave 55% of our surplus, closing 61%; one more of them
                        closed is worth about ten cheap deals
  buyer_secs_order      median seconds from an order to our buyer's answer (lower is better). The market sends the
                        next order no sooner than 20 s after the last, so time past 20 s is orders lost: 31% of orders
                        took longer, no-deal ones 23 s at the median and 66 s at p90, and we got 139 orders an hour
                        where 20 s each would give about 170
  outage_min            minutes of the window the market listed no shops (the kit logs 'no shops in the market yet'
                        about every 30 s; 11/5 16:12-16:45 and 17:16-17:23). The per-hour metrics count only the
                        minutes the market was up, so an outage does not read as a price or stock effect
