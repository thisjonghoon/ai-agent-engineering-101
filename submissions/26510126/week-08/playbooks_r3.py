"""Real retailers' pricing playbooks, written in our strategy's numbers, for the meta-harness to borrow from.

    python playbooks_r3.py         # prints each playbook and the numbers it sets

Our meta-harness only ever searched near its own last strategy. These are whole, tested positions from retail
(the user, 11/3: learn from Costco, Walmart and others, as a kind of A/B). Each sets only the numbers it is about;
the rest stay as they are. None is applied by itself: simulate_r3.py replays our own negotiations under each one,
the meta-harness sees that, and a change goes through its usual bounds and per-cycle steps, or through an A/B test
inside the shop (ab_r3.py) when it is a single number worth checking with live buyers. What carries over is the
idea, not the retailer's exact figures: our cost is 25-75% of list, set by a random grade, and every sale is haggled.
Sources: general retail practice; Costco's FY2026 Q3 call (price cuts on its own brand, "strategic, not reactionary");
2026 reports of a two-track "price cuts plus premium" playbook in a K-shaped economy.
