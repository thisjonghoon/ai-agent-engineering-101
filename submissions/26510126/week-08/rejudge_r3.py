"""Re-judge the team's past number verdicts on the measure the board pays for, and mark what cannot be re-judged.

11/9: the 2 h verdicts on the team's numbers compared our raw margin/h before and after a change until 11:13 that day,
so each read the hour of day as much as the number. The team kept them as facts: 31 meta decisions held a number
because it had been "judged in both directions". An agent's memory carries a wrong note into every later session
until something re-checks it (Anthropic, "components of agent memory", 2026: a mislabelled map note sent the agent
down the same ledge three times until a review of the transcript fixed the note).

Each verdict row is re-judged once its two hours have run: our share of the market's paid value over the same
hours, and board points/h net of the market's own change (metrics_r3.shop_side: the ledger cache, else the
10-minute buckets). The result is VERIFIED (confirmed, reversed, or flat within NOISE) or UNVERIFIED when no data
reaches back to the row (the cache keeps ~6 h; the buckets start 11/9). Results are cached in logs/rejudged_r3.json;
the verdict ledger itself is never edited. memory_text() is what the team reads each cycle.
