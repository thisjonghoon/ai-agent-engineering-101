"""Round 3 restock hook: what the shop buys next. The kit runs it every 60 s and buys what it prints.

    python restock_r3.py --state .market        # prints {"buy": [{"sku": ..., "qty": ...}, ...]}

Code only; the meta-harness (meta_r3.py) moves the numbers in strategy_r3.json. The idea:
  - Profit is the balance at the end, so stock is cash waiting to come back. Spend only down to `reserve_cash` and
    hold at most `stock_value` of stock at cost.
  - Be in many categories: a buyer only sees shops that hold something of the ordered category (shops.json offers),
    so one unit in each category is the first claim on the money. A unit's SKU is the one whose list price is
    closest to the category's median (orders take SKUs 0.5-1.5x a reference price), skipping goods above
    `max_list` and food that keeps less than `min_shelf_hours`.
  - Then depth where things sell: settled deals in the market's ledger (the market publishes no demand weights)
    and our own sales add to a category's score; a category with a score keeps up to `depth` units.
  - A cheaper and a dearer SKU (spread_low, spread_high x the median) in categories that sell, since an order only
    takes SKUs within 0.5-1.5x a reference price we cannot see.
  - The SKUs that settle again and again in the ledger, bought by themselves (up to sku_depth units).
  - "Wanted" posts on the forum (구합니다, looking for ...) that name one of our categories or SKUs raise that
    category for this run.
  - Food first (11/3, the instructor's hint: get a feel for the market with food). Goods pay 1% of cost a day while
    they wait and may break, food costs nothing to hold until its date; so goods at cost stay under `goods_frac` of
    `stock_value`, goods above `max_list` are skipped, and food plans rank `food_first` higher. The meta-harness
    can move all three once goods are seen to sell.
  - Supply windows (agent.md, 11/3 20:23): supply opens once every 20 minutes for 3 minutes, and inventory.json
    carries `restock` (open, opens_at, closes_at). Outside a window we print no lines (the kit would wait up to 90 s
    per line and stall), and inside one the depth is `window_depth` times larger, since what is bought must last
    until the next window. Lines that sell (depth, best sellers) rank before breadth.
  - Stop buying `stop_hours` before the round ends: unsold stock at the end is a loss.
The state between runs (last units seen, ledger position, scores) is in .market/restock_state.json.
