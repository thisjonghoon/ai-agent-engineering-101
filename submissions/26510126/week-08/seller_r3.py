"""Round 3 seller: sells units from the stock the kit keeps in $MARKET_DIR/inventory.json, behind A2A v1.0.

    python seller_r3.py --port 9301

Started from the course's starter_round3/seller.py (A2A side, unit lookup, receipt signing). What is ours:
  - Prices are set by code from strategy_r3.json, which the meta-harness (meta_r3.py, Claude haiku) rewrites.
  - Haggling: in a share of negotiations (model_share, drawn once per negotiation) Claude haiku makes each turn's
    call, ReAct style: it reads the unit (grade, shelf life left, list and cost), our ask and floor, every offer so
    far, the turns left, our stock of that SKU, how often buyers ask for it and what the market paid for it and its
    category lately (prices_r3.py: the ledger, with the forum's price posts checked against it), and answers with a one-line reason
    and accept or a counter. Code keeps it honest and safe: it accepts only at or above the floor, counters only
    between the buyer's offer and our last ask (never raising it), and when the model is busy (MODEL_SLOTS calls at
    once), slow (MODEL_TIMEOUT s) or answers nonsense, the rules below decide that turn, so a busy market never
    queues behind `claude -p`. The other negotiations run on the rules alone; logs/talks_r3.jsonl marks which was
    which, and the meta-harness compares the two and moves model_share (a controlled comparison, same hours).
      ask   = list price x ask_frac (food: ask_frac_food, up to fresh_premium more for a full shelf life)
      floor = max(cost x (1 + min_margin), list price x floor_frac (food: floor_frac_food)), never above the ask
    Food close to its date (less than clear_hours left, or grade C) is cleared down to cost x clear_frac: a unit
    thrown away loses its whole cost, a cheap sale loses less.
  - Concession: the counter moves `step` of the way from the last ask to the buyer's offer, never below the floor; an
    offer at or above the floor is accepted once the buyer has made two offers or meets the midpoint.
  - Honest terms in the receipt: the grade claim is the unit's grade now, one grade lower when food is within 3% of a
    grade line (a claim is judged at checkout or at settle); the market's certificate is always shown; goods carry
    warranty_hours from the strategy (0 at the start: a refund costs the whole price and the break rate
    is not published; the meta-harness may raise it if buyers refuse checkouts for want of one).
  - Units promised in an open negotiation or sold in the last 60 s are not offered again (inventory.json can be
    10 s old, and the kit refuses a checkout for a unit already gone).
A/B test (ab_r3.py, experiment_r3.json): when an experiment is on, a new negotiation for a unit of its kind draws
one of two values of one strategy number and keeps it to the end; the outcome goes to logs/ab_r3.jsonl.
Goods older than `goods_age_days` (storage is 1% of cost a day) may go down to cost x (1 + aged_margin).
In the last `endgame_hours` of the round the floor drops to cost (endgame_frac), and in the last `final_hours`
under it (final_frac): stock left at the end has cost money and earns nothing.
Rounds 0-2 have no stock: the week-07 items are sold at the old reserves so the shop keeps working before Round 3.
