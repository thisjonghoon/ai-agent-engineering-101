"""What if the shop had priced differently? Replays our own negotiations under other strategies (no model calls).

    python simulate_r3.py               # the last 24 hours of logs/talks_r3.jsonl under the current strategy and
                                        # each playbook (playbooks_r3.py)

Each line of logs/talks_r3.jsonl is one negotiation as seller_r3.py saw it: the unit's list price and cost, our first
ask and floor, every offer the buyer sent, and how it ended. The replay runs the seller's own rules (ask, floor,
counter by `step`, accept at or above the floor after two offers or at the midpoint, walk after max_turns) against
those same offers under another strategy, and adds up deals, revenue and margin over cost.

What it cannot know, so read it as a first guess for the A/B test, not a verdict:
  - a buyer answers our counteroffers; here its offers are fixed. Where it closed early with us, its later offers
    are unknown, so a stricter strategy that would not have closed by then counts the talk as lost (this is
    pessimistic about holding firm), and a buyer that would have paid more for a firmer shop is never seen;
  - warranties (the break rate is hidden) and freshness pricing are left out; clearance floors are kept as logged.
`fidelity` is the share of talks where replaying what we actually did gives the outcome that really happened: the
lower it is, the less the other rows mean.
